## Update
- [TBD]: Support more LLM APIs providers.
- **August 12th, 2024**: Support for the Batch API to OpenAI inference, reducing costs by half.
- **August 1st, 2024**: Track OpenAI API usage for both text [`ChatOpenAI`](/fast_prompt/chat/chat_openai.py) and vision [`ChatOpenAIVision`](/fast_prompt/chat/chat_openai.py) requests.

## Quickstart

The structure of source code:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE            <- Open-source license if one is chosen
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile           <- Makefile with convenience commands like `make data` or `make train`
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
â”‚                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
â”‚                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml     <- Project configuration file with package metadata for fast_prompt
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
â”‚                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.cfg          <- Configuration file for flake8
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ fast_prompt                <- Source code for use in this project.
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py    <- Makes fast_prompt a Python module
```

Letâ€™s install the library

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taindp98/Fast-Prompt.git
cd Fast-Prompt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

alternative installation from a specific commit hash, use the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/taindp98/Fast-Prompt.git@commit-hash
```

An example for logging a certain LLM request:

```python
from fast_prompt.chat.chat_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()

system_prompt = """
    You possess in-depth knowledge of natural images and can describe them with ease. \
    From the given input text indicating the category name of a certain object, your task involves the following steps:
    1-Imagine a scene containing the input object.
    2-Generate 4 descriptions about different key appearance features of the input object from the imagined scene, with each description having a maximum of 16 words.
    3-Output a JSON object containing the following key:
        "description": <list of 4 descriptions>

    Use the following examples:
        Input text: "sea lion"
        Answer: "description": ["A round-bellied seal sits on a rock, looking intently at something off-camera.", "The seal lies with flippers tucked, sleek body well-maintained.", "The seal's thick, smooth fur and large dark eyes show alertness and curiosity.", "Turquoise water contrasts with the seal's brown fur and grey rock, highlighting its natural environment."]
"""
response = llm.request(system_prompt=system_prompt, user_prompt="British shorthair")
print(response)
```

the output follows:

```bash
